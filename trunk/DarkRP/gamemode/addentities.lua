How to add custom vehicles:
FIRST
go ingame, type rp_getvehicles for available vehicles!
then:
AddCustomVehicle(<One of the vehicles from the rp_getvehicles list>, <Model of the vehicle>, <Price of the vehicle>, <OPTIONAL jobs that can buy the vehicle>)
Examples:
AddCustomVehicle("Jeep", "models/buggy.mdl", 100 )
AddCustomVehicle("Airboat", "models/airboat.mdl", 600, {TEAM_GUN})
AddCustomVehicle("Airboat", "models/airboat.mdl", 600, {TEAM_GUN, TEAM_MEDIC})

Add those lines under your custom shipments. At the bottom of this file or in data/CustomShipments.txt

HOW TO ADD CUSTOM SHIPMENTS:
AddCustomShipment("<Name of the shipment(no spaces)>"," <the model that the shipment spawns(should be the world model...)>", "<the classname of the weapon>", <the price of one shipment>, <how many guns there are in one shipment>, <OPTIONAL: true/false sold seperately>, <OPTIONAL: price when sold seperately>, < true/false OPTIONAL: /buy only = true> , OPTIONAL which classes can buy the shipment, OPTIONAL: the model of the shipment)

Notes:
MODEL: you can go to Q and then props tab at the top left then search for w_ and you can find all world models of the weapons!
CLASSNAME OF THE WEAPON
there are half-life 2 weapons you can add:
weapon_pistol
weapon_smg1
weapon_ar2
weapon_rpg
weapon_crowbar
weapon_physgun
weapon_357
weapon_crossbow
weapon_slam
weapon_bugbait
weapon_frag
weapon_physcannon
weapon_shotgun
gmod_tool

But you can also add the classnames of Lua weapons by going into the weapons/ folder and look at the name of the folder of the weapon you want.
Like the player possessor swep in addons/Player Possessor/lua/weapons You see a folder called weapon_posessor 
This means the classname is weapon_posessor

YOU CAN ADD ITEMS/ENTITIES TOO! but to actually make the entity you have to press E on the thing that the shipment spawned, BUT THAT'S OK!
YOU CAN MAKE GUNDEALERS ABLE TO SELL MEDKITS!

true/false: Can the weapon be sold seperately?(with /buy name) if you want yes then say true else say no

the price of sold seperate is the price it is when you do /buy name. Of course you only have to fill this in when sold seperate is true.
